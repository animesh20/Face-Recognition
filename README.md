# Face-Recognition
The attendance system of a classroom was automated using the developed system; the simple technique of eigenfaces was implemented for purpose of learning.

Face landmark detection was done using dlib and OpenCV was used for preprocessing; CNN was used to get feature vector so that SVM can be used to classify the extracted information; the technique was similar to the one used in OpenFace project and later an application was developed for real time testing in classrooms.

The eigenface code has also been included here.

The dataset is stored in "demo" folder. The code used for different experiments is there in openface/evaluation. Also much of the code used here is taken from the OpenFace project. Reference: B.

The report for the project has been included here. Please go through it.
